# ar
An auto ranged attack addon originally by ykasala (Available here https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxi/comments/c3hmum/update_for_autora/) that I have clean up and adjusted for my own uses.

Includes windower event based auto ranged attacks as well as adjustable automatic weapon skilling.

Commands

  //ar toggle_mode -- Turns the automatic ranged attacks on and off, off by default
  
  //ar toggle_autows -- Turns on automatically wsing at a certain amount of TP, off by default
  
  //ar toggle_autohalt -- Turns on automatically halting ranged attacks at a certain TP, off by default
  
  //ar toggle_ws -- Loops through what ws to trigger automatically, currently Last Stand, Wildfire, Leaden Salute, Trueflight and Coronach are available 
  
  //ar toogle_tp_percent -- Loops the the tp percentages to halt or auto weapon skill at

Simply start shooting with with /shoot <t> and the addon will continue from there
